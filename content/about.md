I currently work with the [Neuromod Team](https://www.cneuromod.ca/) at the [geriatric research center](http://www.criugm.qc.ca/) of the [Université de Montréal](https://www.umontreal.ca/) where I develop [dashQC](https://dashqc-fmri.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a visual quality control dashboard for human Magnetic Resonance Imaging data.

I have recently completed my PhD in Neuroscience at the [Montreal Neurological Institute](https://www.mcgill.ca/neuro/) under the supervision of Drs. Alan Evans at [McGill Centre for Integrative Neuroscience](https://mcin.ca/) and Pierre Bellec at the [Laboratory for brain simulation and exploration](https://simexp.github.io/lab-website/). Broadly speaking, my research has focused on [developing a better characterization of the neurobiological heterogeneity of Autism](https://escholarship.mcgill.ca/concern/theses/9c67ws18b?locale=en) with the goal of making highly confident individual predictions. 

Through my work I have contributed to several scientific software tools in the neuroimaging community.
